# User-Auth
The focus of this project is to create an authentication/authorization system (token/bearer Authentication) to allow access to an API. The project is composed of a front-end built with Angular.js and a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js. The API uses an SqLite database built with Typeorm using migrations. Both front-end and API are written in Typescript.
Authentication strategy sumarized steps:
	1 - Hash the password with bcrypt using a salt.
	2 - Stored the password hash in the database.
	3 - Generate a random string with Node.js built-in crypto to validate the account.
	4 - Hash and store the string in the database.
	5 - Send an email message to user email address with a clickble route to validate the account.
	6 - On successful login generete a jwt token with jsonwebtoken package and send it to the client.
	7 - Client stores the token in localStorage or sessionStorage.
	8 - Every subsequent request will send the token in 'Authorization' header.
	9 - Routes that require authentication will validate the token before allow access to resources.
The authentication system also allows to change password with verification code sent by email and validated in the API and to 
re-send account validation email.
