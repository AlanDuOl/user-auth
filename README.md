# User-Auth
The focus of this project is to create an authentication/authorization system (token/bearer Authentication) to allow access to an API. The project is composed of a front-end built with Angular.js and a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js. The API uses an SqLite database built with Typeorm using migrations. Both front-end and API are written in Typescript.
Authentication strategy sumarized steps:
	1 - Hash the password with bcrypt using a salt.
	2 - Stored the password hash in the database.
	3 - Generate a random string with Node.js crypto module to validate the account.
	4 - Hash and store the string in the database.
	5 - Send an email message to user email address with a clickable route to validate the account.
	6 - On successful login, generete a jwt token with jsonwebtoken package and send it to the client.
	7 - Client stores the token in localStorage or sessionStorage.
	8 - Every subsequent request will send the token in 'Authorization' header.
	9 - Routes that require authentication will validate the token before allow access to resources.
The authentication system also allows the user to change the account password with a verification code strategy and to resend the account validation email.
The validation email and verification code functionalities use a test Ethereal email account, not the email used in the account creation. The account email is used to identify the user.
